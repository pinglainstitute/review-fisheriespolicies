Project Update Overview

This project includes several updates and improvements across different scripts, primarily focusing on optimizing Google API integration and enhancing flexibility with PyReason and Symbolic AI technologies.

Script Updates and Changes

1. llmupdated.py
	•	The function get_pdf_text has been updated to align with the latest changes in the Google API.
	•	Optimizations were made to resolve issues where outdated code could no longer be called.
	•	The updated function ensures smoother text extraction from PDFs using the improved API.

2. llm2updated.py
	•	Integrated the Symbol class into the existing system.
	•	However, it is currently not possible to call both APIs (Google API and Symbolic AI) simultaneously, even after trying various asynchronous methods.
	•	The likely reason is that Symbolic AI is a highly encapsulated product, which does not allow much customization.
	•	Despite this, Symbolic AI can still be used independently, providing robust functionality on its own.

3. llm5updated.py
	•	Switched to using PyReason, which, despite being from the same company, offers better flexibility in its API usage.
	•	Several optimizations were implemented, utilizing PyReason’s KnowledgeBase and Reasoner.
	•	Two specific rule-based recommendations were added for improved user guidance:
	1.	if question_contains('logic') and pdf_context_is('absent') then recommend('provide more context')
	2.	if answer_is('unclear') and pdf_context_is('present') then recommend('clarify the response')
	•	These rules were tested to ensure their effectiveness in providing meaningful suggestions.
	•	Note: This version is specifically designed for macOS. Importing the required packages on Windows has not been successful.

4. llm6updated.py
	•	Introduced delayed initialization for PyReason’s KnowledgeBase and Reasoner, improving efficiency.
	•	Unlike the previous version, init_pyreason is used to process uploaded PDF text as fact_text, allowing the reasoner to analyze the content before generating outputs.
	•	Note: This version is fully functional on Windows, where it has been successfully tested.

Compatibility Notes
	•	llm5updated.py is designed for macOS, with known import issues on Windows.
	•	llm6updated.py works well on Windows, ensuring compatibility with the required packages.

Next Steps
	•	Further exploration is needed to find potential ways to integrate Google API and Symbolic AI together efficiently.
	•	Continued testing on different operating systems to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

 5. Extra Optimization Updates for llm5updated.py and llm6updated.py: The recent updates to llm5updated.py and llm6updated.py focus on enhancing content generation speed and optimizing performance by implementing several key improvements.

1). General Performance Improvements

Key Enhancements:
	1.	Lazy Loading:
	•	Initialize PyReason and Google API clients only when needed, reducing unnecessary resource consumption.
	2.	Reducing Redundant Work:
	•	Avoid re-reading PDFs and running the same processing logic multiple times to save time.
	3.	Caching Results:
	•	Utilize caching to store time-consuming operations like PDF text extraction, preventing repeated processing.
	4.	Efficient Module Initialization:
	•	Load modules and libraries on demand, improving memory efficiency.

Implementation Details:
	1.	Lazy Loading:
	•	Delays the initialization of PyReason and Google API clients until they are actually required, ensuring faster startup times.
	2.	Caching Mechanisms:
	•	@st.cache_resource is used to cache objects such as KnowledgeBase and Google API clients.
	•	@st.cache_data caches large data processing tasks, like PDF text extraction, to avoid redundant operations.
	3.	Avoiding Redundant Work:
	•	Streamlit’s st.session_state is used to store processed PDFs, preventing unnecessary re-processing.
	4.	Code Simplification:
	•	Separation of module setup from the main logic, ensuring cleaner and more maintainable code.

2). Faster Responses and Shorter Answers

Optimizations for Improved Response Speed:
	1.	Shortened Context Usage:
	•	Instead of using the full PDF content, a summary or keywords are extracted to reduce processing time.
	2.	Prioritizing Core Answers:
	•	The system now displays the core part of the answer immediately, without waiting for extensive validation.
 
3). Faster File Monitoring with Watchdog
	•	The integration of Watchdog allows Streamlit to monitor Python script changes more efficiently, enabling faster reloads during development.
	•	Without Watchdog, Streamlit relies on slower polling methods to detect file changes, which can cause delays.
	•	Installing Watchdog improves responsiveness and development efficiency.

4). Asynchronous Google API Calls
	•	Async tasks are used to handle Google API calls and other time-consuming operations, ensuring faster responses.
	•	This prevents the Streamlit UI from freezing while waiting for the API, enhancing the user experience.

Conclusion: These optimizations significantly enhance the performance of llm5updated.py and llm6updated.py, offering:
	•	Faster response times through lazy loading and caching.
	•	Reduced redundant processing using session state.
	•	Improved user experience with asynchronous API calls.
	•	More efficient development workflows with Watchdog.
