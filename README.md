Review of fisheries policies using LLM based semantic search

Step 1: Obtain data [CCM corpus](https://cmm.wcpfc.int/)

Step 2: Import to langcahin

Step 3: Add to vector store

Step 4: Look at using different embeddings (langchain offers different embedding models)

Step 5: Can look at using sematic search see below

Step 5a: Alternatively, we could do something with symbolic AI combined with RAG, soem initatives to do this in the neurosymbolic AI community.
I've found two Pyt hon modules that would be useful
 
## symbolic AI

[Symbolic AI Python moduel](https://pypi.org/project/symbolicai/)

[PyReason](https://github.com/lab-v2/pyreason)

These can be combined with LLM 

Langchain supports different LLM engines, e.g. OpenAI, Llama, etc.  

## Semantic search

Plan is now to use MPNet with the WCPFC corpus or alternatively a RAG model.

MPNET paper here [MPNet: Masked and Permuted Pre-training for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09297)

## Data 

WCPFC CMM corpus is here [WCPFC CMMs](https://cmm.wcpfc.int/)
